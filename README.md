## Overview of Analysis   
I was asked to help analyse employee data from Pewlett Hackard to find trends and predict future needs for position roles that will need to be filled. Utilizing SQL through pgAdmin, I was able to create queries for the given csv files to analyse the data in different perspects and produce usable tables to formulate predictions.
## Results   
* By producting the retirement_titles table, one can see employees that are eligible for retirement and the duration of their employment.   
* Utilizing our retirement_titles table to produce our unique_title tables, it shows the retirable employees' recent occupation title.   
* Lastly we refine our analysis by producing our retiring_titles table which displays the number of retirable employees in each occupational title.   
* The next query produced the mentorship_eligibility table. It shows a list of potential candidates within the company that can be qualified for the mentorship program to fill some of the senior roles that will open up.   


## Summary
90,398 employees may retire soon within a similar time frame. 57,669 of those being in senior positions.
Only 1549 employees meet the criteria for the mentorship program.   
Based on this information alone, there is not enough people internally to fill the future vacant roles. This would mean Pewlett Hackard will need to begin recruiting outside the company and possibly tweak the criteria for qualified candiates for the mentorship program.   
Recommendation to gather external data of the eligible labor market pool to see if the current internal labor shortage might be alleviated.
